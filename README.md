# wiezen

This is an implementation of a whist-server and client in python.
It started out as a way to play this card game during the Covid19 crisis as a replacement to the lunchbreak games we played among colleagues. 

Whist (Wiezen in Dutch/Flemish) is a card game played by four players. It is a trick based game, a more popular variant of whist is color whist. Color whist had some decent implementations regular whist dinâ€™t so this project is a typical scratching-an-itch open-source project.

There are probably as much variants on the rules as there are families playing the game. This server implements the rules played by me and my co-workers.
